# ESP8266 based webserver to change color of two ws2811 LEDs

## chip
My [azdelivery chip](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0754N794H) is to be configured in the Arduino IDE as LoLin(Wemos) D1 R2 & mini

## config
A confg.json must be added inside the `data`-folder with the following content:
``` JSON
{
  "STASSID":"my-ssid",
  "STAPSK":"my-password"
}
```

## measured power consumption
